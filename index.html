<!-- WELCOME O DIGITAL TRAVELER

The code of this particular website, albeit mine, isn't really something I'm proud of. More out of laziness and interest in other projects, I've neglected to update it's structure for years, and laugh at how some of the things are organized. In particular, I made this with bootstrap & some really unnecessary jquery. If you've ever read http://motherfuckingwebsite.com, you'll get an idea of how emarassed I am.  I guess you can laugh along too - know you're not alone ^__^

MAY RED PANDAS BLESS YOUR EVERY STEP -->

        2016 - Now<br/>
        Currently I work on Splunk's Machine Learning team as a Software Engineer.<br/><br/>

        2014 - 2016<br/>
          I was a Senior Technical Training Instructor at Splunk. I taught people how to make big data
          useable, valuable, and accessible via classes on exploratory data analysis, querying,
          processing and visualizing data, statistical modeling, data science and machine learning.

          I'm interested in cognitive science, machine learning, and linguistics. You can read my
          senior thesis on <a href="docs/AlexanderJohnsonThesis.pdf">the role of morphology in vector
          space semantics</a>. Since then, I've been focusing on more general NLP techniques.

                Dimensionality Reuced Exploratory Data Analysis (DREDA) is a pedagogical tool I made in Javascript for exploring high dimensional data that has been
                reduced to 3 dimensions. The website is primarily a tool for presentation, intended to be used by a
                data analyst who is well versed with their data set. It's assumed they have already clustered and
                reduced their dataset. The site features an upload form where users can upload their own dataset.
                The minimal design, dark background, and rotation are intended for large scale projection,
                presentation and display purposes - in conjunction with teaching the value of dimensionality
                reduction as well as its ability to provide insight into large, high dimensional datasets.

              <p>
                  It is all clientside javascript and uses three.js / WebGL. In general, it scales to 100,000+ points.

                This was a project that scrapes <a href="http://www.foopee.com/punk/the-list/">the list</a> for music shows and plots the points
                on a map. I found myself loading the list all the time but sometimes forgetting exactly where particular venues
                were located. Its really just a tool for myself, but maybe some other people will have fun using it as well. It uses YQL to scrape
                the data and mapbox and leaflet to do the mapping. You can check out code open sourced <a href="http://github.com/metasyn/sfpunkshowmap">here</a>.
